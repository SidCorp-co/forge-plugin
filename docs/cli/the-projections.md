# What the projections leave out

The uuid column was 22% of the browse verb's bytes and bought nothing. A null `plan` and an empty
`attachments` were 179 bytes of an issue's 1,938 and said only that the field exists, so absence means
empty. `format: "uuid"` and a 150-character regex asserting the same thing appear together on every id
field; a pattern *without* a format is kept, because that one carries the only copy of its rule.

Guides come back as Markdown, not Markdown escaped inside JSON: 49 `\n` and 10 `\"` per guide, each
tokenizing worse than the character it stands for.

Nothing here keeps its own copy of names the server already publishes — a local list goes stale
against the thing it describes, silently, and reports the server's newest feature as a typo.
