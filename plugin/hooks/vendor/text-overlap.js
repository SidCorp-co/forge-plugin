// VENDORED — do not edit. Upstream: eslint-plugin-code-quality v0.11.0, commit cb51676,
//   src/text-overlap.js
//
// A copy of packages/code-quality/src/text-overlap.js, because Claude Code caches plugin/ alone
// and packages/ is not reachable from where this runs — the same reason lint-edited-file.mjs is
// copied here. The duplicate-comment ESLint rule and skill-dup.mjs measure overlap the same way,
// so the measurement has one home, and plugin/scripts/check-vendor.mjs compares the two copies on
// every `npm run check`.

/**
 * Whether two pieces of prose say the same thing, measured rather than read: text stated twice
 * has two authorities, and the pair diverges the first time someone corrects only the copy they
 * found — silently, because each still reads as correct. A Jaccard index over content words
 * decides it, above a `floor` of words the two must share before the index is computed at all,
 * which is what keeps it quiet. A clean result is a floor on quality, never a proof of absence.
